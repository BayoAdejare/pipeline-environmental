# GreenFlow: Advanced Data Pipeline for Environmental Insights

## Overview

GreenFlow is a comprehensive data engineering solution designed to collect, process, and analyze environmental data from various sources. This project aims to provide valuable insights to organizations and policymakers to support sustainable decision-making, environmental monitoring, and climate change mitigation efforts.

## Features

- Real-time ingestion of data from environmental sensors, satellite imagery, and government databases
- Scalable data processing using Apache Spark
- Orchestration and data versioning with Dagster software-defined assets
- Data lake storage using Delta Lake for efficient querying and analysis
- ETL pipelines for data transformation, enrichment, and integration
- Machine learning models for environmental forecasting and anomaly detection
- Interactive data visualization dashboards using Tableau
- Automated data quality checks and monitoring
- CI/CD pipeline for data workflows

## Tech Stack

- Apache Spark: Large-scale data processing
- Apache Kafka: Real-time data streaming
- Delta Lake: Data lake storage
- Dagster: Workflow orchestration and data versioning
- Docker: Containerization
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration
- Python: Primary programming language
- Scala: For some Spark jobs
- Tableau: Data visualization
- MLflow: Machine learning lifecycle management
- Great Expectations: Data quality testing
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- Delta Lake
- Dagster

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/greenflow.git
   cd greenflow
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Initialize the data lake:
   ```
   docker-compose run spark-master ./init_data_lake.sh
   ```

4. Start the Dagster development server:
   ```
   dagster dev
   ```

5. Access the Dagster web interface at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Configure your environmental data sources in `src/data/ingestion/`
2. Define your data processing jobs and Dagster assets in `assets/dagster_assets.py`
3. Run your ETL pipelines using Dagster commands:
   ```
   dagster job execute -f assets/dagster_assets.py -n your_job_name
   ```
4. Monitor your data pipelines and assets through the Dagster web interface

## Data Quality Tests

We use Great Expectations for data quality testing. Test suites are located in the `tests/quality/` directory.

To run data quality tests:

1. Navigate to the project root
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   great_expectations checkpoint run my_checkpoint
   ```

This will execute the defined expectations against your data and generate a data quality report.

## CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`. They include:

- Automated testing on pull requests
- Data quality checks on scheduled intervals
- Deployment of updated Dagster assets and Spark jobs to production
